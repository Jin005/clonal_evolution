The spatial CA is written in Java and was modified for this paper from an earlier publication: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003433
The non-spatial CA is in python.  All analysis code for the paper is included in these files. 
The needed functions can be found in CSC_functions.py (for the non-spatial CA), and clonal_evolution_functions.py for all else. 
If any contingencies are missing, or anyone has questions, please feel free to email me at jacob.g.scott@gmail.com and i'll happily fill in the blanks to the best of my ability.
